# GPAAnalysis

Program Purpose:
Develop a system that will do some basic analysis of grades. The intent is to find the GPA of a section, the GPA of all the sections in a group, and then compare each section GPA against the group GPA to determine if there is a significant difference between the two. A section may be in more than one group.

Requirements:
a) Design and implement a means of computing GPA per section and per group. GPA is based on university definitions found in the catalogue under Grading Policies.
b) Design and implement a means of determining if the section GPA is significantly different than the group GPA (one sample Z-test and we can let z≤-2 or z≥2 be considered significant)
c) Design and implement a means of producing easy to read results
d) Provide final report encompassing the entire effort using a standardized format

Approach:
a) Work as a team to gather ideas and solutions to meet the requirements and customer’s expectations on a weekly basis.
b) Implemented Java as the backend using Visual Studio Code/Eclipse by sharing code through GitHub

        (iii)Encapsulation
        (iv)Data abstraction
c) Execute the file using Java API to execute the program
